## My Story

A brief timeline of my development career written as a narrative.

<dl>
  <dt>1994-1997 â€¢ DeVry University â€¢ Pomona, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Bright-eyed and Bushy Tailed -</i></dd>
    <dd>Schooled at DeVry University in technology, programming, and information systems. Graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a Bachelor of Computer Information Systems (BSc CIS) degree.</dd>
  <dt>1997-1998 â€¢ Kirtland AFB â€¢ Albuquerque, NM</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Proving Myself -</i></dd>
    <dd>Worked at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, NM - Underwent FBI background check and was granted secret clearance to work on web-based collaboration applications dealing with guidance systems and other technologies relevant to our armed forces.</dd>
  <dt>1998 - 2000 â€¢ âœ¨ Microsoft âœ¨ â€¢ Redmond, WA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- The Promised Land -</i></dd>
    <dd>Worked at Microsoft as a Release Program Manager writing web-based applications to manage the cataloging, scanning, workflow, and distribution of all Microsoft's downloadable content to microsoft.com's Download Center. This was a wonderful example of the kind of dynamic, creative, and engaging company culture I thrived in and am looking to join once again.</dd>
  <dt>2000 - 2002 â€¢ Velodea â€¢ Milan, Italy</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Going International -</i></dd>
    <dd>Left Microsoft to join The Velodea Group - Became employee number seven of this dotcom startup. It was here I experienced a new level of intensity and self-determination. I traveled frequently between Los Angeles and Milan offices and served as the head of technology and lead developer for many corporate projects, both internal and external.</dd>
  <dt>2002 - 2006 â€¢ devAware Technology Solutions â€¢ Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Opportunities at Home -</i></dd>
    <dd>Wanting to settle down locally, I transitioned to the role of independent contractor and freelance developer under my own company umbrella. This was liberating, stressful, and intensely time consuming. It helped me realize I love coding, development, and technology but am less excited with administration, payroll, and collections. I did learn to wear many hats while working with such companies as Sony, Fox Studios and Xtreme Desktops.</dd>
  <dt>2006 - 2014 â€¢ Velodea (v3) â€¢ Pasadena, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- New Opportunities with Old Friends -</i></dd>
    <dd>In 2006 I was invited to return to Velodea to help lift the company out of a financial deficit. Together with the Managing Director we streamlined operations with smaller dev teams, tighter turn-arounds, and more effective project management.</dd>
    <dd>Within a year the company was able to pay off $200k worth of corporate debt and begin to turn a profit once again.</dd>
    <dd>The success of these efforts assured another eight years of fulfilling and prosperous work before the untimely passing of our CEO and Managing Director, Michael Leong.</dd>
  <dt>2014 - 2016 â€¢ <i>Three-year Hiatus</i> â€¢ Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Being of Service -</i></dd>
    <dd>Needing a recharge, I took some time off and was called upon to care for a loved one who had fallen ill. I stepped into the role of caregiver and for the next two years provided in-home care until her passing.</dd>
  <dt>2017 - 2018 â€¢ <i>Education, Certification & Training</i> â€¢ Los Angeles, CA</dt>
    <dd style="text-align:left"><i>- Back to School -</i></dd>
    <dd>Having been absent from the development landscape for a time, I found technology had progressed at a breakneck pace. To close the gap I began a full-time program of online courses and self-study.</dd>
    <dd>I re-engaged with the development community and have been coding, learning, and absorbing with a passion. I set out to master today's most in-demand technologies and have earned a Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree in the process. I'm now continuing my journey with Front End frameworks such as React, Redux, ReactNative, and Vue.</dd>
